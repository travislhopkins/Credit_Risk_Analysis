# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 1 Challenge

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model that is capable of predicting credit card risk (i.e. the level of risk a customer presents to the credit card company). The model will help credit companies more accurately avoid issuing credit cards to customers that likely cannnot pay their debt, therefore saving the credit company money.

Data
The data used in this analysis was sourced from LendingClub, a lending services company. There exists 68,817 records and 86 columns.
